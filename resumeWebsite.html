	<h2>US Navy Experience</h2>
		<p><p class="pFont">Enlisted in 2009 as a Master-At-Arms (Military Police).  During my eight years I had two tours, one in Washington
		and another in Belgium.  In Washington I was in a joint command with Marines providing strategic weapons security.
		In the beginning, I would stand watch in tours and inspect vehicles.  As I strived to better myself, I qualified to become
		an alarm monitoring sentry and even further a supiviser.  I was in charge of 70 personnel over 35 watch stations on a day to day
		basis.  When we would do convoy movements I would be in charge of 35 personnel over 15 watchstations.  Some of my daily responsiblities
		included: Invetory of the armory, guard mount to make sure all sailors are ready to stand post, conducted drills for mission readiness
		and trained sailors for mission critical qualifications.</p>
		<p><p class="pFont">I transferred to Mons, Belgium to the headquarters of NATO to provide law enforcement and security.  During my time there, I was a patrolman
		as well as shift supiviser.  The work environment was unique in that I was provided the opporunity to work with 28 other nations.  My day to day 
		operations included: traffic enforcement, physical security of restricted areas, escorts for VIPs to include: King of Jordan, King and Queen of 
		Belgium and other national and foreign dignitaries.  The base hosted many festivals that I would provide security for, to include: SHAPEfest which
		would have upwards to 15000 people attending, SACEUR change over, Make-A-Wish and Oktoberfest.  I would work inconjunction with the local federal
		police in order to keep SHAPE safe.</p>
